# react-cosmos
A very opinionated library for building a universal react app

### My motivation

I haven't found a application framework for building a universal react app that I believe to be fully production ready with solid documentation and tools for speeding up developers working with the framework

### Existing libraries and starters

- Universal redux
 - https://github.com/bdefore/universal-redux
 - Good that it works but limited documentation and not easy to follow how it goes together

- Universal hapi example
 - https://github.com/luandro/hapi-universal-redux
 - Good example but not a library, lots of boilerplate

- Universal react easy
 - https://github.com/keystonejs/react-easy-universal
 - Made by some very prominent js guys tho uses browserify instead of webpack

- Universal react
 - https://github.com/DominicTobias/universal-react
