#### Approach

The approach I'm going to try and take is vertical slices to deliver one working chunk at a time across the core, cli and example-app

### Epics

- [ ] Initial bootstrap of project + server that reloads when files are changed
- [ ] Add app with react, redux, routing + universal rendering

#### Initial bootstrap of project + server that reloads when files are changed

- [x] 'New' command hooked up
- [ ] Cli functionality to bootstrap an app
- [ ] Simple server that returns `hi, welcome to funicular`
- [ ] Server reloads when server file is changed
- [ ] Full integration test under docker that tests the bootrap then runs and tests the server

#### Done Epics

- [x] Front page mission statement for project
- [x] Publish initial modules to NPM to bagsy name during inital development
